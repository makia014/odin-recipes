# odin-recipes

This repository is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. It is a Recipes project to practice essential HTML skills achieved in the [Foundations Path](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

Due to the fact that I know some CSS, I've decided to give this project some styling as well.
