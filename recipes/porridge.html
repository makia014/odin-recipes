            <p>
              When the searing rays of the morning sun have chased the Viking
              out of bed, it's breakfast:<br class="main-br" />
              <em>
                Oat porridge, Barley porridge, Beer bread<br />
                For the porridge maybe a dollop of butter,<br />
                Sour milk with dried fruit and nuts,<br />
                Bread with butter and cheese,<br />
                Maybe a piece of cold meat if there was something "left over
                from yesterday"<br />
                or a fatty piece of herring.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>3-4 dl coarsely ground barley flour</li>
          <li>1 liter of water</li>
          <li>2 apples and possibly a handful of hazelnuts</li>
          <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Boil the water. When the water boils, whisk in the flour a little at
            a time. Continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. The
            apples and chopped nuts are cooked with the last few minutes. Remove
            the pan from the heat and set it near the heat for 1/2 to 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            A little honey or a dab of butter on top of the porridge is good.
            The apples can be replaced or supplemented with seasonal berries and
            fruits.
          </li>
          <li>
            The water can be completely or partially replaced with milk, but
            then the porridge will burn easily. If you have made butter, you can
            conveniently add the buttermilk from there.
