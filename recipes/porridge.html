            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>When the searing rays of the morning sun have chased the Viking out of bed, it's breakfast:<br>

                Oat porridge Barley porridge Beer bread<br>
                For the porridge maybe a dollop of butter<br>
                Sour milk with dried fruit and nuts<br>
                Bread with butter and cheese<br>
                Maybe a piece of cold meat if there was something "left over from yesterday"<br>
                or a fatty piece of herring.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>3-4 dl coarsely ground barley flour</li>
                    <li>1 liter of water</li>
                    <li>2 apples and possibly a handful of hazelnuts</li>
                    <li>salt</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Steps</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Boil the water. When the water boils, whisk in the flour a little at a time. Continue boiling for 5 minutes, stirring constantly. The apples and chopped nuts are cooked with the last few minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and set it near the heat for 1/2 to 1 hour.</li>
                    <li>A little honey or a dab of butter on top of the porridge is good. The apples can be replaced or supplemented with seasonal berries and fruits.</li>
                    <li>The water can be completely or partially replaced with milk, but then the porridge will burn easily. If you have made butter, you can conveniently add the buttermilk from there.</li>
                </ol>
