        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          During the Viking Age, bread was usually baked in the form of flat
          cakes on embers, directly on the stone slab or on so-called frying
          pans, flat plates with long handles that were held over an open
          hearth. There were also occasional vaulted baking ovens for larger
          leavened breads.
        </p>

        <p>
          The higher you were on the social ladder, the finer bread you ate.
          Flat breads were often used as plates to eat from. The sauce from what
          you ate was then absorbed by the bread and eventually you could sink
          your teeth into the bread - if you were still hungry. In the cases
          where the bread was eaten as a plate, the bread was of a coarser kind.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Flour</li>
          <li>Liquid - whey, water or milk</li>
          <li>Any seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Coarsely ground wheat flour is kneaded with so much liquid that it
            becomes a cohesive and not too wet dough that easily slips from the
            fingers. Seeds from plantains, beech, chopped nuts or finely chopped
            fruit (apples and rose hips are particularly suitable) can be mixed
            into the dough. Salt and honey in the dough also gives a good taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            The liquid can be whey (after cheese making) which is particularly
            good, but it is also possible to use water, buttermilk or regular
            milk. The dough is then formed into walnut-sized balls that are
            pressed into flat small loaves.
          </li>
          <li>
            Larger potsherds or flat stones are then placed on the embers. These
            are preheated in the fire. The flat breads are placed on these
            baking sheets. You can also bake the bread in a frying pan. If this
            method is used, the bread is baked over an open fire. The loaves
            should be turned often and are ready when they sound hollow when you
            tap them with your fingernail.
