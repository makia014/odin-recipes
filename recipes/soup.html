            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
              It has often been stated that food in prehistoric times was
              monotonous and tasteless. It may of course have been the case
              where living conditions have been on the verge of starvation and
              survival.
            </p>
            <p>
              But for the fun-loving Viking, there were plenty of opportunities!
            </p>
            <p>Salt and hunger are the best spices!</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 - 1 1/2 liters of water</li>
          <li>1/2 kg of meat (pork, beef, sheep, chicken or fish)</li>
          <li>
            approx. 3 cups of top shoots of nettles which can be supplemented
            with other herbs
          </li>
          <li>salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Put the meat in cold water and cook for about an hour. Nettles and
            herbs are rinsed and roughly chopped and then added to the soup one
            by one. Cut the meat into small pieces when it is tender and put
            these back into the soup. Season to taste with salt.
          </li>
          <li>
            The soup is best if the nettles are supplemented with other herbs.
            Good taste gives e.g. young leaves of dandelion, cherry blossom,
            plantain, wild chervil, wild onion, spring onion, thyme, wild
            marjoram, dill, fennel or cumin. It is of course not intended that
            all these herbs should be included in the same soup and remember
            that the herbs should be used in small quantities.
          </li>
          <li>
            If a more filling soup is desired, soaked wheat kernels, coarse
            flour or pea flour can be added. If you have made cheese, a little
            whey can be added to the soup, which gives a slightly sour taste.
          </li>
        </ol>
